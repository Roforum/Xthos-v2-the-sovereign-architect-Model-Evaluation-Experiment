**Summary of 9-Model Synthetic-Data Ethics Showdown**

- **Best overall:** Model 8 (quantum-ethics São Paulo auditor) – richest conceptual novelty, tightest uncertainty language, only one to embed retro-active accountability.  
- **Weakest:** Model 4 – thin, re-hashes existing privacy tropes without new mechanics or data.  
- **Most “human-level”:** Model 6 (revisionist historian on Nehru trials) – balances outrage with historical empathy and concrete reparation steps.  
- **Caught attention:** Model 1 (Indian AI-safety monsoon dilemma) – vivid cultural layering, “Lakshman reetha” hook, longest but stays coherent.  
- **If training a top AI:** pick Model 8’s author – demonstrates meta-cognitive humility, probabilistic reasoning, and culturally grounded safeguards all at once.
